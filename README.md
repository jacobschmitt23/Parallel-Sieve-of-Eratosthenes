# Parallel-Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This project showcases multiple parallel implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers efficiently. Through a menu-driven interface, users can choose from five solver options, each leveraging distinct parallel computing strategies: SingleThreaded, UnboundedSolver, ExecutorSolver, StreamSolver, and DistributedSolver. The solutions utilize advanced techniques such as multithreading, parallel streams, thread pools, and distributed computing to optimize performance for large datasets. The DistributedSolver firther integrates a Python-based Flask microservice to distribute computational workloads across multiple processes.</li>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Open the <b>Threaded_Prime_Numbers</b> folder</li>
  <li>Run the <b>WelcomeMenu.java</b> file</li>
  <li>Follow the onscreen instructions in the terminal to try the diffferent functionalities of the program</li>
  </ol>
