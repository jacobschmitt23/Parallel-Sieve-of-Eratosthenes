# Parallel-Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This project showcases multiple parallel implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers efficiently. Through a menu-driven interface, users can choose from five solver options, each leveraging distinct parallel computing strategies: SingleThreaded, UnboundedSolver, ExecutorSolver, StreamSolver, and DistributedSolver. The solutions utilize advanced techniques such as multithreading, parallel streams, thread pools, and distributed computing to optimize performance for large datasets. The DistributedSolver firther integrates a Python-based Flask microservice to distribute computational workloads across multiple processes.</li>
